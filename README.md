Neotoma - Hands on Computing Workshop, October 20, 2013
========================
*The course outline and manual for a workshop to teach paleoecologists how to use the neotoma package for R.*

Purpose:
---------------------------
*This workshop is intended to provide a basic introduction to the R computing environment through a workflow that focuses on paleoecological analysis using the newly developed neotoma package for R.  Workshop participants will find site data using the [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://neotomadb.org), download data and plot and perform basic analysis on the resulting datasets.*

Requirements
---------------------------
Users are expected to:
* Bring their laptops to the workshop
* Have [R](http://www.r-project.org/) installed on their laptop with a suitable editor.  We recommend [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
* Users may also bring their own datasets if interested.

Background
---------------------------
The R user and development community has contributed to R over time to the point that it is an incredibly powerful tool for analyis, and provides an opportunity for open and reproducible research.  The paleoecological community has a history of data sharing, including the COHMAP Project, North American Pollen Database, North American Modern Pollen Database and Neotoma.  With the development of the neotoma package for R we hope to include both data and data processing in this spirit of sharing.
Recent paleoecological work such as Goring et al. ([2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.05.019)), Gill et al. ([2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12130)) and Goring et al. ([2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12135)) have explicitly included both R code and data to allow for reproducible work.  As our analytic methods increase in complexity, **Methods** sections become hard pressed to describe all the choices we make in analysis.  In addition, the recent, [highly publicized errors](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/04/16/memo-to-reinhart-and-rogoff-i-think-its-best-to-admit-your-errors-and-go-on-from-there/) in high-profile research, make the case for providing reproducible code all the more compelling.

So lets all get on the reproducible science train using R and neotoma and our own intellectual curiosity!

Schedule
---------------------------------
This is the second of a two day workshop.  The last hour of the day will be given over to a discussion of the analytic needs of the paleoecological community.

Time   | Topic         | Link
------ | ------------- | -----------
 8:30  | Introduction to R, RStudio and R workflows |
 9:30  | Basic searches with `neotoma` |
 10:00 | What does a pollen object look like? |
 10:30 | Getting and plotting data |
 11:30 | Eating some food |
 12:30 | Doing some stuff and learning some things |
 1:30  | Free time for discovery |
 2:30  | Quantitative round table |
 
 This schedule isn't set in stone.

Getting Started
---------------------------------
If you have some familiarity in R already we hope that the workflow we've designed will give ou enough freedom to play around with other features while we walk through some of the more fundamental R concepts.  If you are new to R we hope that the code that you take some time to familiarize yourself with R before the workshop.  There are a number of excellent tutorials available online.
